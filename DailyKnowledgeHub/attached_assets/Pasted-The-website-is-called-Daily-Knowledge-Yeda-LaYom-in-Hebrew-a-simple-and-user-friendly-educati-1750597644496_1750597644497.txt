The website is called "Daily Knowledge" ("Yeda LaYom" in Hebrew), a simple and user-friendly educational platform designed to present students of all ages with a new, interesting topic every day. The design is clean and bright, using light colors like blue, white, or green, with clear and readable fonts such as Alef or Assistant. Icons (e.g., 🧠, 📚, 📅) are used alongside titles to enhance visual engagement. The top navigation bar includes links to: Home, By Topic, By Age, Daily Quiz, About, and Contact. On the homepage, a new educational topic is displayed each day. It includes the date (e.g., June 22, 2025), a headline like "Why doesn't the sun burn out?", followed by a short 2–3 sentence teaser, a relevant illustration or photo, and a button labeled "Read More." At the bottom, there’s a section titled "Related Topics You Might Like," and on the side, a list of popular topics from the past week. The “By Topic” page presents a grid of colorful, icon-labeled categories such as Math, Science, Geography, History, Language, General Knowledge, etc. Clicking a category shows all previous topics from that subject, each displayed as a card with a title, date, short summary, and a “Read More” button. The “By Age” page allows users to choose their educational level – Elementary, Middle School, High School, or General – and displays age-appropriate content. For example, elementary students might get "What do good bacteria do in our stomach?" while high school students might read "What’s the connection between derivatives and driving a car?" The “Daily Quiz” page features 3–5 multiple choice questions related to the day’s topic. After submitting, users see their score along with explanations. The questions are displayed in separate cards, and there's a light animation showing stars or a check mark after scoring. The “About” page explains the purpose of the website, who it’s for, how topics are selected, and a motivational message like: "Every day you learn something new—even if it’s just for three minutes." The “Contact” page includes a simple form with fields for name, email, and a message box for sending questions, topic suggestions, or feedback, with a "Send me a reply" button. The page includes an envelope icon and clean centered layout. Each topic also has its own full-page view with the title (e.g., "How is a rainbow formed?"), a header image, the date, the main article divided into 3–5 short paragraphs with subheadings, and a sidebar suggesting similar topics and links to further reading. Additional small features include a search bar, a "Random Topic" button at the top, and an optional Dark Mode for accessibility and comfort. This entire website is designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and educationally valuable, providing students with a quick, enriching experience every day, no matter their age or interests.
